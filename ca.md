## Assignment Title: "EDEN"

## Brief 

Your task is to observe and record birds, insects, nematodes bacteria or any living creatures, and simulate it, artistly or realistically using a game engine. You can fork [this repository](https://github.com/skooter500/miniature-rotary-phone) and use the examples for steering behaviors and state machines in your project.

EDEN Will be Exhibited at Audio Garden Festival in August

## Deliverables     

Photographs/videos of your primary research. Go into nature, find something interesting and photograph/video it. You can store your research in a photo gallery and link to it from your git repo.

- Fork one of the starter code repos and study the examples
- Use the code and examples to create a visual simulation that models something you observed from your primary research. Birds flying, fish swimming, toads jumping, plants growing, a creature eating another creature, reproduction, cell growth, nematodes, your dog, bed bugs, paratites, your family members.
- A user interface that allows you to change parameters on the simulation and observe the effects on the simulation
- A brief comparission of your observations versus the simulation
- A demo video, assignmentreadmefile in the the correct format


## Marking Scheme:

## Groovyness - Visuals & sound, Quality of outcome

| Grade | Indicative Aspects |
|-------|------------|
| 1     | Project looks amazing with a high level of polish on the visuals. Great use of color and form. The simulation is fully controllable with variables exposed and a UI to control the simulation interactively. There is lots of functionality and interactivity - for example buttons to press, sliders to change values in the siumulation and observe the effect on movement, animation etc. Highly artistic interpretation of a natutal system that conveys a realistic sense of the source material. Use of visual effects such as particle system, post-processing or custom shaders to enhance visual quality. Has a clear visual style. Has great sound effects. Deployed and running on a device |
| 2.1 | Attempt to model the source material but has glitches. Looks pretty good with decent models. No visual effects. Maybe a particle system. Sound effects grabbed from online sources. Some simple interactivity and button presses. Less coherent visual style. Good novelty value. Running in editor |
| 2.2 |  One or two models imported from online sources. No reference  material. No interactivity, just an animated visual. Perhaps using entirely the starter code. Running in editor. Little or no sound |
| Pass | Model from online source or primitive that does not do anything |
| Fail | Does not compile or little or no content |
 
 ## Complexity - Coding, maths, algorithm and system design 

 | Grade | Indicative Aspects |
 |-------|------------|
 | 1 | 15-20 hours work. A complex system that has lots of interactivity. 5 or 6 new MonoBehaviors or Nodes that interact and work together to implement the functionality of the system. A complex algorithm such as a generative system. Several hundred lines of self written. Nice gizmos on all the MonoBehaviors/Node and ranges on public fields. Code separated into appropriate methods and classes, following [SOLID principles](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/conceptual-articles/s-o-l-i-d-the-first-five-principles-of-object-oriented-design). Code demonstrates techniques we have learned on the course including: Boids/Procedural Animation/Proceduiral Generation/Path Finding. Advanced use (such as scripting) of systems including animation, shaders, particle systems. Deployed and demoed a device.  |
 | 2.1 | 10-15 hours work. A less complex system that has interactivity. Several self written MonoBehaviors/Nodes with other code included from tutorials and online sources. No gizmos. Long methods. Around 100 lines of self written code, using some of the techniques we learned on the course such as manipulating the transform, Boids. Working on PC in the editor.  |
 | 2.2 | 5-10 hours work. A simple system with a script or two based on excamples from the course. Or most of the functionality is derived from tutorials with little customization or understanding. Little interactivity. Works in editor, but not tested as a build or on device. No use of other Godot systems. Random colors. No audio or inappropriate audio. |
 | Pass | < 5 hours work. A single script or all from a tutorial. Compiles and runs |
| Fail | No submission or nothing works |

## Project Management & Documentation

| Grade | Indicative Aspects  |
|-------|------|
| 1 |  30-40 commits. Feature branches. For team projects, an equal distribution of the commits. Commits all commented. All sections of the template filled out. Document includes reflective elements - What did I learn? Sources properly referenced. Embedded, public, listed youtube video (DO NOT CHECK THIS VIDEO IS MADE FOR KIDS). The video is made from a build, not from the Editor and demonstrates all the features of your project. Video has a talking head explaining the project. Source material included in the repo  |
| 2.1 | 20-30 commits. One or two branches. All sections of the template filled out. Sources properly referenced. Source material included in the repo. Issues with the video. 
| 2.2 |10-20 commits, terse or no comments. No branches. Documentation incomplete, Evidence of reflective learning missing. missing references. Issues with the video |
| Pass | < 10 commits. terse or no comments. No branches. Documentation incomplete. No video |
